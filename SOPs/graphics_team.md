<h2>🍭 Graphics Team</h2>

- The tasks will be equally distributed between the team members ensuring the no team member is overburdened.
- The task will be conveyed to the Graphics Lead and the lead has to allocate the task to a member of the design team. If the Design Lead doesn’t reply within four hours, then the DSC Lead will assign the task to a member.
- If a member knows that he/she cannot complete the task within the deadline due to some reason, he has to inform the team lead.
- The task’s deadline will be given according to the circumstances, however on average; the member will be given at least 5-6 hours to complete the task.

**Note:** This time limit of 5-6 hours can change as well depending upon the kind of task at hand.

- If a task has to be assigned then, the details of that task will be posted in the group as well.
- The written content (if required) will be provided by the publications team or the one assigning the task.
- In case of any inquiry, the members will contact their team lead immediately.
- The team will work together efficiently to ensure the smooth completion of tasks.
- The performance of each person in the team will be evaluated based on their tasks.
- If any member’s performance goes down considerably, he will be given a warning letter. If that member again fails to work, then he will be dismissed from the team.
